# MotionArguments are meant to be used as vendor-specific or use-case-specific arguments to
# MotionPrimitive messages. This is to avoid bloating the MotionPrimitive message with all possible
# uses cases but rather add specific data using as a list of key-value pairs, which is what this
# message represents.
MotionArgument[] additional_arguments # (max) velocity, (max) acceleration, efficiency

# Targets should be either specified through joint configurations or Cartesian poses.
# Depending on the motion type and implementation, there might be multiple poses allowed.
# For example, circular motions are often specified as via and target
# Usually one of these is empty, in some edge cases even both can be empty, when all input is given
# in the more flexible MotionArgument[] field.
